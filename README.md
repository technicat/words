This is a JSON-formatted list of list of words, partitioned by length, each sublist ordered alphabetically, which I put together long ago for a typing game as a hard-coded array in a Unity C# script (available in my unityscripts repo).

There are just over 1600 words, culled from a dictionary, omitting proper nouns, swear words, variations of the same word, and other words that I thought weren't quite right for this app. But it was over ten years ago, so it's also missing words newly-added to dictionaries since then.
